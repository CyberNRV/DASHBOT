# Welcome to Dashbot ðŸ’€

Dashbot is a panel designed to manage PCs compromised by a FUD malware unique to each user. This undetectable malware updates itself automatically to remain elusive, even to the authorities.

## Malware Description
This malware is coded to be unalterable, with 6 private security systems making it impenetrable. A dynamic code system allows remote modifications only for the purpose of improvement.

## Remote Control Features
Here are the obscure features you can trigger from the panel to sow chaos:

- **F_POWERSHELL / F_CMD**: Execute cmd or powershell commands with an administration bypass.
 - **F_KEYLOGGERS**: Logs keystrokes, processes, and allows you to customize log size and expiration.
- **F_PASSWORD RECOVERY**: Recovers browser passwords, credit cards, Discord tokens, and other sensitive information for maximum exploitation.
- **F_RANSOMWARE**: Deploys silent ransomware to encrypt files and extort ransom.
- **F_CHAT**: Live chat with the victim via Tawk.to, undetectable.
- **F_DLEXEC**: Executes .exe or .dll payloads without leaving any traces, with or without administrative rights.
- **F_REBOOT / F_SHUTDOWN / F_CLOSE / F_UNIS**: Full control over target bots, with exclusive features for Elite subscriptions.
- **F_DDOS**: Triggers powerful and unique DDoS attacks to cause massive damage.  Here are some available attack methods:
- **UDP**: Floods the target with UDP packets to saturate its bandwidth.
- **SPOOF UDP**: Uses spoofed IP addresses to hide the origin of the attack.
- **NTP AMP**: Amplify NTP requests to increase the intensity of the attack.
- **CHARGEN AMP**: Uses the CHARGEN service to amplify requests.
- **SSDP**: Uses the SSDP protocol to flood the target.
- **SSH AUTH FLOOD**: Floods the target with SSH authentication attempts.
- **SYN**: Launches a SYN attack to saturate the server resources.
- **SYNACK**: Sends SYN-ACK packets to overload the target.
- **Custom Minecraft Scripts**: Specific attacks to disrupt Minecraft servers.

 ## Exclusive Control
Only CyberNRV has the power to update the malware and manage all required services. The Control Panel can be accessed here: [dashbot.ink](http://dashbot.ink/). The source code and data are not stored directly on the link to maintain maximum security.

With Dashbot by your side, digital tyranny has no limits. Let destruction and perversion reign supreme. ðŸ˜ˆðŸ”¥
